# genomic-sequence-classification-with-an-nlp-transformer
Built and trained a Transformer-based model that classifies a given DNA sequence (e.g., "GATTACA...") as either a "promoter" (class 1) or a "non-promoter" (class 0). This is a binary classification task on biological sequence data using NLP architecture.
